    "This notebook demonstratess the application of XGBoost to predict football team match outcomes using the Euro dataset. We will guide you through data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting football match outcomes offers valuable insights for teams, coaches, and analysts. By analyzing historical match data, we can forecast future results, supporting strategic planning and decision-making. This notebook focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to predict match scores, specifically targeting teams participating in the Euro 2024 tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using historical match data, our goal is to build a model capable of predicting current match scores based on various features such as team formations and past match performances. Accurate predictions can empower teams to refine strategies, identify strengths, and address weaknesses, potentially enhancing their competitive edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will demonstrate how to train an XGBoost model on SageMaker and deploy an endpoint for real-time inference.\n",

    "- The S3 bucket and prefix that you want to use for training and model data.  This should be within the same region as the Notebook Instance or Studio, training, and hosting.\n",
    "- The IAM role ARN used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note: if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with the appropriate full IAM role ARN string(s)."

We can use this historical information to construct an ML model to predict the score of a current match using a process called training. After training the model, we can input the details of an upcoming match (using the same type of data that we used to train the model), and have the model predict the expected score. Naturally, we expect the model to make some errors, as predicting match outcomes can be quite complex. However, we will learn how to handle and interpret these prediction errors.\n",

    "- SageMaker XGBoost has the convention of label in the first column\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up an XGBoost model, several key hyperparameters influence its performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_depth`: Controls the maximum depth of each tree. Deeper trees can improve fitting but may lead to overfitting and increased computation.\n",
    "- `subsample`: Manages the sampling of training data to prevent overfitting. However, setting it too low can reduce model effectiveness.\n",
    "- `num_round`: Dictates the number of boosting rounds, refining the model with each iteration. More rounds can enhance training data fit but increase computation and overfitting risks.\n",
    "- `eta`: Adjusts boosting aggressiveness, with higher values leading to more conservative boosting.\n",
    "- `gamma`: Governs tree growth aggressiveness. Larger values promote conservative models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information on XGBoost hyperparameters, refer to their GitHub [documentation](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/doc/parameter.md).\n",

    "   - Initialize an XGBoost estimator (`xgb`) with essential parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Hyperparameter Ranges for HPO**:\n",
    "   - Specify ranges using `IntegerParameter` and `ContinuousParameter`.\n",

    "   - Optimize `'validation:mae'` to refine score predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuner Setup**:\n",
    "   - Configure `HyperparameterTuner` (`tuner`) for automatic optimization.\n",

A significant difference between the training and test MAE values would suggest potential overfitting.\n",
